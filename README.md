 ## Reflection

While building this project, I learned:
- How to structure a simple HTML page with semantic tags.
- How to link CSS stylesheets and apply consistent styling.
- Importance of folder structure (keeping `images/`, `style.css`, `index.html` organized).
- Basic Git workflow (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) for version control.

Challenges I faced:
- Forgetting to stage changes before committing (solved using `git add .`).
- Adjusting CSS layout for proper alignment.

Next Steps:
- Make the page responsive using media queries.
- Add more screenshots to showcase the layout.
- Experiment with different color themes and typography.
